  title: "Preparing Matcha",
  content: [
    "Matcha was introduced to Japan by Zen Buddhist monks in the 12th century, evolving into a meditative practice known as Chanoyu. This ritual relies on specialized tools designed to transform stone-ground tea into a vibrant, frothy bowl of mindfulness.",
    "The scoop measures the perfect amount of powder, while the sifter ensures a clump-free, velvety texture. The chasen is hand-carved from a single piece of bamboo and its fine tines suspend tea particles to create the signature foam. The whisk holder preserves the Chasen’s delicate shape after use."
